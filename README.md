![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c796894e-6d3c-4722-911e-aa832a2ed9a3)



## üìù Problem Statement:  
**Objective:**

CDP is an essential protocol for Cisco network devices, simplifying network management and troubleshooting by providing a straightforward way to discover and display information about directly connected Cisco equipment. Proper configuration and usage of CDP can greatly enhance network visibility and operational efficiency.

---

You are tasked with configuring and verifying Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on a network consisting of multiple Cisco devices. The network diagram shows the connectivity between various routers and switches. Your objective is to ensure that CDP is properly configured and operational across all devices to facilitate network discovery and troubleshooting.

### Steps to Achieve the Objective:

1. **Enable CDP Globally on All Devices**:
   - Verify if CDP is enabled globally on each device.
   - If CDP is not enabled, enable it globally.

2. **Enable CDP on All Relevant Interfaces**:
   - Identify all the interfaces that connect to other Cisco devices.
   - Ensure CDP is enabled on these interfaces.

3. **Verify CDP Neighbor Information**:
   - Check the CDP neighbor table on each device.
   - Confirm that each device can see its directly connected neighbors.

4. **Collect and Document Neighbor Information**:
   - Document the details of each neighbor as shown in the CDP neighbor table.
   - Include information such as device name, local interface, neighbor interface, and capabilities.

5. **Troubleshoot CDP Issues**:
   - If any device does not display its neighbors correctly, verify the physical connectivity.
   - Ensure that CDP is not disabled on any necessary interfaces.
   - Check for any potential issues that might be blocking CDP packets (e.g., VLAN configuration, interface errors).

6. **Validate CDP Information Accuracy**:
   - Cross-check the discovered CDP information with the physical network diagram.
   - Ensure that all connections match the expected topology.

7. **Maintain CDP Configuration**:
   - Implement best practices for CDP configuration, such as setting the CDP timer and holdtime appropriately.
   - Regularly review and update the CDP neighbor information to reflect any network changes.

8. **Security Considerations**:
   - Evaluate the security implications of CDP in your network.
   - If necessary, disable CDP on interfaces connected to untrusted networks or devices.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8322667-2fd1-4ae4-8ca7-681f233aaf6a)


## üìù Problem Statement:  
**Objective:**

LLDP is a vendor-neutral protocol used by network devices to advertise their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on a local area network (LAN).

---

### Goal
Use the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) to discover and verify the network topology.

### Tasks
1. Enable LLDP on all network devices (routers, switches, IP phones, and VPC).
2. Verify connectivity and discover neighboring devices using LLDP.

### Topology Information
- **Switch**
  - Connects to:
    - **VPC4** on port `eth0`
    - **IP_Phone-1** on port `eth0`
    - **Router-1** on port `Gi0/2`

- **Router-1**
  - Connects to:
    - **Switch** on port `Gi0/2`
    - **IP_Phone-2** on port `eth0`
    - **Router-2** on port `Gi0/1`

- **Router-2**
  - Connects to:
    - **Router-1** on port `Gi0/0`

### Device Configuration

#### Switch Configuration
1. Enable LLDP globally.
2. Enable LLDP on interfaces `Gi0/0`, `Gi0/1`, and `Gi0/2`.

#### Router-1 Configuration
1. Enable LLDP globally.
2. Enable LLDP on interfaces `Gi0/0`, `Gi0/1`, and `Gi0/2`.

#### Router-2 Configuration
1. Enable LLDP globally.
2. Enable LLDP on interface `Gi0/0`.

#### IP Phone-1 and IP Phone-2 Configuration
- Ensure LLDP is enabled if necessary through the phone's configuration interface (most IP phones support LLDP automatically).

#### VPC4 Configuration
- Since VPC typically does not support LLDP natively, verify the connection through the switch‚Äôs LLDP neighbor table.

### Verification
1. Verify LLDP neighbors on the switch.
2. Verify LLDP neighbors on Router-1.
3. Verify LLDP neighbors on Router-2.
4. Verify LLDP neighbors on IP Phones through their settings or documentation.

By performing these steps, ensure all devices are properly discovered and that the topology is correctly identified according to the LLDP advertisements. This process assists in network troubleshooting, documentation, and ensuring proper connectivity across the network.
